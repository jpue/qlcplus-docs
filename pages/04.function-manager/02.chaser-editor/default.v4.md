The chaser editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit ![](/basics/chaser.png) [Chaser](/basics/glossary-and-concepts#chaser) functions.  
A Chaser is composed by steps and each step is represented by

* A progressive number
* The related function name
* Fade in time
* Hold time
* Fade out time
* Step total duration time
* A note field in case you need to write something to remember what the step does

The timings steps and the note field can be modified by double clicking on them. By default the times are taken in seconds (for example 135 means 2m15s), unless you use the same syntax QLC+ uses (for example 1m12s.80)
